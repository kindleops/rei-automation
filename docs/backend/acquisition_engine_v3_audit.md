# Acquisition Decision Engine — V3 Audit (Phase 0)

**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Author:** Engine V3 refactor (Phase 0 — audit before implementation)
**Scope:** Read-only audit of the live `public` schema and the existing engine. **No production data was modified. No migrations were applied. No migration repair was run.**
**Engine under audit:** `apps/api/src/lib/acquisition/acquisitionDecisionEngine.js` (3,667 lines, single module).
**DB:** Supabase project `lcppdrmrdfblstpcbgpf` (`real-estate-automation`), Postgres 17.

---

## 1. Executive summary

The V2 engine can emit catastrophically wrong, **autonomously-actionable** offers (a $173M cash offer on a $391K Austin duplex; a $20.99M offer on a $309K Caldwell house). The root cause is **not** a bad formula constant — it is that the engine treats **rows as transactions** and **never validates a comp's consideration against any independent anchor**.

The contamination is **systemic, not anecdotal**. The comp source (`recently_sold_properties`, 55,893 rows) contains **193 distinct "broadcast" considerations repeated across 3,794 parcels** spanning many ZIPs/cities on a single date — i.e., one institutional **package/portfolio price stamped onto every parcel in the package**. `7,470 / 55,893` (~13%) of comp rows carry a `sale_price > $3M`, the overwhelming majority on small SFRs. `buyer_purchase_events_v2` mirrors the same corrupted distribution (it shares lineage).

The good news: **the raw data already contains the fields needed to detect and neutralize this** (`apn_parcel_id`, `buyer_name_clean`/`buyer_key`, `sale_date`/`recording_date`, `document_type`, and a usable buyer registry in `buyer_entities_v2`). The V2 engine simply never used them, and the **primary comp view (`v_recent_sold_comps`) does not expose them**.

## 2. Live anomaly reproduction (BEFORE)

Pulled from `public.property_acquisition_scores` (persisted V2 output):

| property_id | address | subject est. value | comp_count | valuation_mid | valuation_conf | recommended_cash_offer | decision_tier |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2136762817 | 5314 Atascosa Dr, Austin TX (Multifamily 2-4, 2u, 1,776sf) | $391,000 | **1** | **$332,498,300** | 55 | **$173,028,700** | CREATIVE_TERMS |
| 242567952 | 1711 N Illinois Ave, Caldwell ID (SFR, 1,550sf) | $309,000 | 12 | **$30,871,400** | **81** | **$20,994,500** | CREATIVE_TERMS |
| 2130847744 | 6310 Cambridge Glen Ln, Houston TX (SFR, 1,356sf) | $156,000 | 12 | $208,200 | 69 | $80,900 | CREATIVE_TERMS ✅ plausible |

**Anomaly 1 contaminating comp identified (live):** `2000 E Stassney Ln, Austin TX 78744`, Multi-Family, 2 units, 1,728 sf, `sale_price = $332,500,000`, sale_date 2025-04-09 — **same ZIP (78744) and near-identical physical profile** to the subject duplex. The value `$332,500,000` is **not unique to this row**: it appears on dozens of unrelated SFRs across Fort Worth, Houston, Spring, Humble, Arlington, Pflugerville, Elgin, Hockley, Kennedale on four shared dates (2025-01-16, 04-09, 07-16, 10-22). It is a **broadcast package/sentinel value**, not a duplex sale.

**Anomaly 2 (Caldwell):** the persisted score still shows 12 comps → $30.87M mid, confidence 81, offer $20.99M (computed 2026-06-20). The specific source rows were not reproducible by a narrow value+geo filter today (the comp set is recomputed per run and the underlying data has refreshed), but the **mechanism** — many parcels sharing one package consideration and one date — is reproduced at far larger scale across the table (see §4).

**2130847744 is the "good" control:** its 12 comps were *not* contaminated (the broadcast prices fell outside its radius/window, or were a minority that MAD removed), so its $208K valuation is plausible. This is exactly the case the refactor must **preserve**.

---

## 3. Exact root causes in V2 (with code references)

All line numbers in `apps/api/src/lib/acquisition/acquisitionDecisionEngine.js`.

1. **Rows are treated as independent transactions — no clustering.** `loadComparableProperties` (3391) merges three sources and de-dups on a key of `property_id | address | sale_date | sale_price` (3470-3480). A package sale split across **different** parcels has different `property_id` and `address`, so all N parcels survive as N "independent" comps. There is **no** grouping by `(buyer, date, consideration, document, APN-spread)`. → Anomaly 2 (12 "comps"), and the systemic 3,794-parcel problem.

2. **No independent plausibility anchor.** `adjustedCompPrice` (1165) blends PPSF/PPU/raw and then clamps the result to **the comp's own sale price** `clamp(blended, salePrice*0.55, salePrice*1.65)` (1230). A $332.5M consideration produces a ~$332.5M adjusted comp. Nothing compares the comp to the subject AVM, tax assessment, lane PPSF/PPU ceilings, or neighborhood medians.

3. **Outlier removal is disabled exactly when it's needed.** `removeOutliers` (1348) returns early with **no filtering for `< 5` comps** (1349). Anomaly 1 had **1** comp → straight through. And for `≥ 5` comps it uses median/MAD on `adjusted_price` (1352-1355); when the contamination is the **majority / identical** (a broadcast price), the median *is* the contaminated value and MAD ≈ 0 → nothing is rejected. → Anomaly 2.

4. **Duplication is rewarded as "consistency" and "depth."** `calculateValuation` (1411): `dispersion = stddev/mid`; identical duplicated comps → dispersion ≈ 0 → `consistencyScore = clamp(100 - dispersion*180) = 100` (1433) and `depthScore = clamp(count/8*100) = 100` (1430). This is precisely the **confidence 81 / consistency 100** seen in Anomaly 2. Effective sample size is never corrected for correlated rows.

5. **Contaminated valuation propagates into the investor ceiling and the offer.** `calculateInvestorCeiling` (1538) falls back to `valuation.mid * factor` when no buyer events qualify (1571-1593). `offerCalculation` (2524) sets `valuationCeiling = valuation.mid * maxArvFactor - repairs` (2543) and, when investor confidence `< 45`, blends `valuationCeiling*0.75 + behaviorCeiling*0.25` (2549). For Austin: even though `investor_ceiling_mid` was a sane $424K, the $332.5M valuation dominated 75% of the effective ceiling → **$173M offer**. The offer is **not** bounded by a conservative buyer exit.

6. **Asset lanes are too coarse; mismatched lanes comp freely.** `canonicalAssetType` (580) + `assetFamily` (607) collapse everything into `residential | multifamily | commercial | land | other`. `assetCompatible` (1105) returns true for any same-family pair, so **condo ↔ SFR**, **duplex ↔ 200-unit apartment** (both "multifamily"), and **storage ↔ office ↔ strip** (all "commercial") are mutually eligible. There are no DUPLEX/TRIPLEX/FOURPLEX, MF size-band, storage, retail, office, or land sub-lanes.

7. **Confidence can reach 100 with comps regardless of quality.** `calculateAcquisitionDecision` (2865): `confidenceCap = selected.length ? 100 : 45`. Any non-empty comp set unlocks full confidence.

8. **No hard invariants.** Nothing enforces `offer ≤ conservative buyer exit`, `value ≤ K× anchor`, single-comp share caps, NaN/Infinity guards, or unit normalization.

---

## 4. Systemic contamination scope (live evidence)

`recently_sold_properties` (n = 55,893):

| metric | value |
|---|---:|
| rows with `sale_price > $3M` | **7,470** (13.4%) |
| rows with `sale_price > $50M` | 2,184 |
| broadcast considerations (same price on ≥4 parcels across ≥3 ZIPs) | **193** |
| parcels inside those broadcast clusters | **3,794** |

Representative broadcast clusters (one consideration → many unrelated parcels, one date, often one buyer):

| consideration | parcels | distinct ZIPs | distinct cities | date(s) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| $1,029,832,300 | 89 | 38 | 21 | 2024-04-18 |
| $751,093,560 | 92 | 18 | 8 | 2025-12-15 |
| $627,220,020 | 84 | 38 | 21 | 2024-09-30..10-01 |
| $577,233,300 | 87 | 42 | 25 | 2024-11-26..12-02 |
| $332,500,000 | (Anomaly 1) | many | many | 4 dates |

`buyer_purchase_events_v2` (n = 55,479) shows an **identical** price histogram (same considerations, same counts, frequently `distinct_buyers = 1`) → it is derived from the same ingest and exhibits the same package-broadcast pattern. These are **real institutional package acquisitions** — extremely valuable as **demand** signals, but the **per-parcel price is fiction**.

## 5. Source inventory & grain

Legend — Conf = audit confidence in the field's meaning. ✅ present / ⚠ partial / ❌ absent.

### `properties` (subject; n≈ scored universe) — **rich**
- **Grain:** one row per subject property. **Price:** `estimated_value`, `mls_current_listing_price`, `sale_price`/`sale_date` (last sale). **Asset:** `asset_class/subclass/subtype/type`, `asset_type_confidence`, `normalized_asset_class`, `land_use`, `county_land_use_code`, `zoning`, `commercial_units`, `multifamily_units`, `storage_units`, `strip_center_units`, `is_vacant_land`, `is_infill_lot`. **Physical:** `building_square_feet`, `lot_square_feet/acreage`, `total_bedrooms/baths`, `year_built/effective_year_built`, `building_condition`, `avg_sqft_per_unit`. **Income:** `monthly_rent`, `rent_estimate`, `gross_monthly_income`, `gross_annual_income`, `noi_estimate`, `cap_rate` (sparse). **Debt/creative:** `total_loan_balance`, `total_loan_amt`, `total_loan_payment`, `lien_position`, `lien_type`, `lienholder_name`, `active_lien`, `equity_amount/percent`. **Distress:** full foreclosure/preforeclosure/auction/default/tax-delinquent. **Parcel:** `apn_parcel_id`. **Buyer/seller identity:** owner only (no transaction counterparties). **Conf:** High.
- **Limitations:** income/debt fields are sparsely populated; `cap_rate`/`noi_estimate` not reliable for income lanes.

### `recently_sold_properties` (PRIMARY comp base; n=55,893)
- **Grain:** **one row per parcel**, *not per transaction*. **Price:** `sale_price` (⚠ contains package/broadcast considerations), `mls_sold_price`. **Date:** `sale_date`, `recording_date`. **Buyer identity:** `buyer_name`/`buyer_name_clean`/`buyer_key` ✅. **Seller identity:** `owner_name`/`owner_name_clean`/`owner_key`/`is_corporate_owner`/`out_of_state_owner` ✅. **Doc identity:** ❌ no deed/instrument/document number. **Parcel:** `apn_parcel_id` ✅. **Asset/physical:** `property_type/class`, `county_land_use_code`, `units_count`, `building_square_feet`, beds/baths, year built, `construction_type`, `exterior_walls`, `renovation_level_classification`. **Income:** ❌. **Conf:** High on grain.
- **Duplication risk:** **HIGH** — package considerations broadcast across many parcels (§4). **Package-sale risk:** **HIGH**. Clustering keys available: `(buyer_key|buyer_name_clean, sale_date, sale_price)` across distinct `apn_parcel_id`.

### `v_recent_sold_comps` (VIEW; the path the engine actually uses via RPC)
- **Grain:** per parcel (wraps the comp base). **Exposes:** address, lat/lng, `sale_date`, `sale_price`, `mls_*`, `units_count`, physical, `normalized_asset_class`, `computed_ppsf`, `sale_source`, `is_recent_6_months`, `is_usable_comp`.
- **CRITICAL GAP:** **does NOT expose** `buyer_name/buyer_key`, `owner/seller`, `apn_parcel_id`, `recording_date`, or any document field. → The **primary comp path is structurally blind to transaction identity.** V3 needs an **additive** view extension to surface clustering keys. Interim: cluster by `(sale_price, sale_date, address-batch)` which still catches broadcasts.

### `buyer_comp_properties_v2` (modeled comp; "advanced" source)
- **Grain:** per parcel. **Rich:** `apn_parcel_id`, `last_sale_doc_type`, `document_type`, `recording_date`, `sale_date`, `sale_price`, `sale_price_source`, `auction_date`, `default_date`, `legal_description`, `total_loan_amount/balance/payment`, `lienholder_name`, `tax_*`, `assessed_*`, `calculated_*_value`, full physical, `hoa_*`, `mls_*`, `ppsf/ppu/ppbd`, `comp_confidence_score`, `deal_grade`, `batch_id`, `source_record_id/source_deal_id`. **Buyer/seller identity:** ❌ (no buyer/seller name columns). **Conf:** High.
- **Use:** best source for **channel classification** (`document_type`, `sale_price_source`, `auction_date`) and physical detail; lacks counterparty identity for clustering.

### `buyer_purchase_events_v2` (buyer-side fact; n=55,479)
- **Grain:** per (buyer, parcel) purchase event; **links** to comp via `comp_property_id`, to entity via `buyer_entity_id`. **Identity:** `buyer_key`, `buyer_name`, `buyer_type`, `is_corporate_buyer`, `out_of_state_owner` ✅. **Price:** `purchase_price` (⚠ same broadcast contamination), `purchase_price_source`. **Date:** `purchase_date`, `recording_date`. **Doc:** `document_type`. **Dedup:** `source_dedup_key` ✅. **Conf:** High.
- **Use:** investor/institutional **demand** and buyer-behavior; cluster by `(buyer_key, purchase_date, purchase_price)`. **Do not** use per-parcel price from package clusters as a comp.

### `buyer_entities_v2` (buyer registry — **already exists**)
- **Grain:** one row per canonical buyer (`buyer_key`). **Has:** `normalized_buyer_name`, `is_corporate_buyer`, `is_repeat_buyer`, `mailing_address_*`, `purchase_count(_180d/_365d)`, `markets_active`, `counties_active`, `zips_active`, `preferred_asset_classes`, `preferred_price_min/max`, `avg_purchase_price`, `median_purchase_price`, `avg_ppsf`, `avg_units`, `investor_score`, `velocity_score`, `corporate_buyer_score`, `dispo_priority_score`. **Conf:** High.
- **Use:** the seed for V3 buyer-entity resolution + institutional registry + observed buy-box. Build **on** this, not from scratch. Multiple mailing addresses/subsidiaries per parent will require an additive alias layer.

### `property_valuation_snapshots` (parallel valuation)
- **Grain:** per property valuation snapshot. **Has:** `estimated_arv`, `median_sale_price/ppsf/ppu`, `low/high_value`, `repair_estimate`, `conservative_offer`, `target_offer`, `max_allowable_offer`, `buyer_exit_price`, `included/excluded_comp_count`, `included/excluded_comps` (jsonb), `comp_methodology`, `asset_class`. **Conf:** Medium (separate lineage; may itself be contaminated downstream).

### `property_acquisition_scores` (engine output)
- **Columns (live):** `property_id`(text), `valuation_low/mid/high`, `valuation_confidence`, `comp_count`, `weighted_comp_score`, `investor_ceiling_low/mid/high`, `buyer_demand_score`, `liquidity_score`, `estimated_repairs`, `recommended_cash_offer`, `minimum_acceptable_offer`, `expected_assignment_fee`, `subject_to_score`, `seller_finance_score`, `lease_option_score`, `novation_score`, `best_strategy`, `aos_score`, `confidence`, `decision_tier`, `evidence`(jsonb), `computed_at`, `created_at`, the pressure/situation scores, `owner_situation_primary/scores`, `recommended_conversation_angle`, `recommended_offer_stack`(jsonb).
- **Missing for V3 (additive migration needed):** `engine_version/model_version/formula_version`, `input_data_as_of`, `canonical_asset_lane`+confidence, separate valuation universes (retail/investor/institutional/income/liquidation), `conservative_buyer_exit`, novation/creative term blocks, return metrics, multi-dimensional confidence, `execution_state`, anomaly flags, transaction-cluster summary, active feature flags. **No `scored_at`** (use `computed_at`).

### `census_geo_metrics` (Stage 5 context)
- **Grain:** per geo (`geo_level` tract/zcta/county, `geoid`). **Allowed:** `median_household_income`, `vacancy_rate`, `renter_rate`, `owner_occupancy_rate`, `median_year_built`, `housing_age`, totals (`total_population/households/housing_units`, occupied/vacant/owner/renter units), pre-computed `*_heat_score`, `acquisition_pressure_score`, `source_year`, `variables`(jsonb), `raw`(jsonb). **Conf:** Medium.
- **Guardrail:** `variables`/`raw` jsonb may contain protected-class fields — the V3 Census allowlist must read **only** the named market columns above and never iterate `raw`.

### `campaign_target_graph` (downstream consumer)
- Carries `acquisition_score`, `cash_offer`, `estimated_value`, `equity_*`, owner-financial `net_asset_value`/`buying_power`/`income`. **Risk:** contaminated `cash_offer` propagates here. **Guardrail:** owner-financial fields must **never** reduce intrinsic property value (mission §21/§32).

---

## 6. Comp loader & RPC lineage

`loadComparableProperties` (engine 3391) does:
1. `rpc('get_comp_candidates_for_subject', { p_subject_property_id, p_radius_miles, p_months_back, p_limit:100 })` → ids → detail from **`v_recent_sold_comps`** (identity-blind). **Primary.**
2. If RPC empty → fallback scan of `recently_sold_properties` filtered by zip/market/state, `limit 100`.
3. **Always** also scans `buyer_comp_properties_v2` filtered by zip/market, `limit 150` ("advanced").
4. Merge + de-dup on `property_id|address|sale_date|sale_price` (does **not** collapse cross-parcel packages).

`loadBuyerPurchases` (3484): `buyer_purchase_events_v2` filtered by zip/market/state, `order purchase_date desc, limit 250`.

**RPC/view definition** for `get_comp_candidates_for_subject` / `v_recent_sold_comps` was not found in `apps/api/supabase/migrations` (only referenced in `20260526174304_create_deal_context_index.sql`) → consistent with the known **migration drift** (repo migrations ≠ prod's real history). The view exists in prod; its definition must be treated as prod-authoritative and extended additively.

---

## 7. PGRST204 / schema-cache risks

- The engine's `SELECT` constants are hand-maintained column lists against tables/views. Adding V3 columns to `property_acquisition_scores` (or selecting new comp columns) **before PostgREST refreshes its schema cache** will throw `PGRST204` on upsert/select.
- V2 already has partial tolerance: `isOptionalSourceMissing` (3066), `isMissingColumnError` (3070), `missingColumnName` (3078), `optionalEnrichmentQuery` (3111), `optionalQuery` (3192). **Required** sources still throw (correct — must fail loud).
- **Mitigation for V3:** additive migrations only; new persisted columns must be nullable; the writer must degrade gracefully if a new column is absent (write-subset) and **log loudly** rather than convert a required failure into an empty result. Reload PostgREST schema cache after migration.

---

## 8. Fields available to fix it (feasibility)

Transaction clustering is feasible **today** on the identity-bearing sources:
- **Sold base / buyer events:** cluster `(buyer_key | buyer_name_clean, sale_date | purchase_date, consideration)` across distinct `apn_parcel_id`/`property_id`; flag **package** when one `(price,date[,buyer])` spans ≥ K parcels or ≥ M ZIPs.
- **Primary view path:** until `v_recent_sold_comps` is extended, cluster on `(sale_price, sale_date, address-batch)` — still catches every broadcast in §4.
- **Plausibility anchors (independent of comps):** subject `estimated_value`, `assessed_total_value`, lane PPSF/PPU ceilings, Census `median_home_value`/`median_household_income` (low weight).
- **Buyer resolution:** `buyer_entities_v2` already provides canonical key, corporate flag, buy-box, velocity.

## 9. Remediation → V3 module map

| Failure (§3) | V3 module(s) | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| Rows≠transactions; packages | `transactionClustering.js` | 1 |
| No plausibility anchor; price implausible | `transactionQualification.js`, `modelConstants.js` | 1 |
| Outlier logic defeated | clustering + qualification (pre-valuation) | 1 |
| Duplication→fake consistency/depth | effective-sample-size in clustering; confidence model | 1/5 |
| Contaminated value→ceiling→offer | hard invariants + `offerEconomics.js` (buyer-exit-anchored) | 2 |
| Coarse asset lanes | `assetClassification.js` | 1 |
| Confidence cap too loose | `confidenceModel.js` | 5 |
| No invariants/gates | `acquisitionInvariants.js`, `executionGates.js` | 1/2 |

---

## 10. Safety attestation

- All queries were **read-only** `SELECT`. No `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL`. No migrations applied. No `supabase migration repair`. No SMS/queue/provider activity. Production scoring behavior is unchanged by this audit.
- New V3 code lands as **new modules + tests**, default-off behind feature flags, with **no rewiring of the live engine** until explicitly authorized.

---

## 11. Required migrations (to be generated, not applied)

1. **Additive** columns on `property_acquisition_scores` for V3 lineage/universes/execution-state/anomaly/cluster-summary (§5).
2. **Additive** extension of `v_recent_sold_comps` to surface `apn_parcel_id`, `buyer_name_clean`/`buyer_key`, `owner_key`, `recording_date`, source lineage (§6) — enables identity-based clustering on the primary path.
3. (Stage 5) buyer alias/parent layer over `buyer_entities_v2` for institutional registry.

Migration state is **drifted** (repo ≠ prod). Generate files; **do not** apply or repair without explicit authorization and a prod-history reconciliation.

---

## 12. Live join-lineage audit (Item 5A, 2026-06-21)

Proven against prod (read-only) before rewiring the loader.

### Candidate → source identity chain
- `get_comp_candidates_for_subject(p_subject_property_id, p_radius_miles, p_months_back, p_limit)` returns rows keyed by **`comp_id` (uuid)** plus `property_id`, address, `asset_class` (normalized, e.g. `single_family`), `sale_price`, `sale_date`, `mls_sold_price/date`, beds/baths/sqft/units/year, `building_condition`, `construction_type`, `distance_miles`, `similarity_score`, `comp_confidence_score`. **No buyer / APN / document / recording fields.**
- **`comp_id` === `v_recent_sold_comps.id` === `buyer_comp_raw_v2.id`** — verified **5000/5000** (and 8/8 on the Houston probe). This is the deterministic primary-path identity key.
- `v_recent_sold_comps.id` is **NOT** equal to `buyer_comp_properties_v2.id` nor `recently_sold_properties.id` (0/5000 each). Candidate `property_id` matches `recently_sold_properties`/`buyer_comp_properties_v2` only ~1/8 of the time — those are different datasets; do not join candidates to them by `property_id`.

### Identity fields available on `buyer_comp_raw_v2` (by `id`)
`owner_name` / `owner_1_name` (grantee = comp buyer), `apn_parcel_id`, `document_type` / `last_sale_doc_type`, `recording_date`, `sale_price`/`saleprice`, `mls_sold_price`, `is_corporate_owner`, `out_of_state_owner`, `owner_address_full` (buyer mailing), `total_loan_amt`/`balance`/`payment`, `lienholder_name`, `subdivision_name`, `school_district_name`. Table: 47,985 rows; 40,351 with owner; 31,759 priced+owner.

### Dead / mismatched joins (do NOT use)
- `buyer_purchase_events_v2.comp_property_id` is **NULL for all 55,479 rows** → the event→comp FK is unusable; cannot enrich comp buyers from purchase events.
- `recently_sold_properties.buyer_key` (`buyer_…`) ≠ `buyer_entities_v2.buyer_key` (`bk_…`) — different schemes (0/5000).
- `buyer_entities_v2` joins by **`normalized_buyer_name`** = `lower(strip-entity-suffix(name))` — deterministic but sparse for comp buyers (**208/5000 ≈ 4%**); use only as bonus buy-box/velocity enrichment, never required.

### Cardinality / rates
- candidate↔`buyer_comp_raw_v2`: **1:1**, ~100% match, collision rate 0 (uuid PK).
- candidate buyer identity coverage: governed by `buyer_comp_raw_v2.owner_name` (~84% have owner). Rows without owner → `IDENTITY_UNRESOLVED` (pricing eligibility reduced/removed).
- `sale_price = 0` is common in candidates (non-sales / current-owner records) → channel = NON_SALE, excluded from pricing.

### Decision
Production-compatible enrichment = `candidate.comp_id → buyer_comp_raw_v2` (batch `.in('id', ids)`), buyer archetype from `owner_name` + `is_corporate_owner`, optional `buyer_entities_v2` by normalized name. **No migration required.** The previously generated `v_recent_sold_comp_identity` (which selected from `recently_sold_properties`) is the **wrong source** for the primary path and is amended in this pass (see §14). The blind `buyer_comp_properties_v2` ZIP pull in the V2 loader is the contamination/cross-lane vector and is removed from the V3 path.

## Item 5C — Income Intelligence Foundation: data-source audit

*Read-only audit (repo grep + live Supabase introspection, project `lcppdrmrdfblstpcbgpf`). No writes, no DDL.*

### Headline finding

Across **24,972** properties with `units_count >= 2`:

| Field | Coverage | Notes / basis |
|---|---|---|
| `monthly_rent` | **0%** | column exists, entirely null |
| `rent_estimate` | **0%** | entirely null |
| `gross_monthly_income` / `gross_annual_income` | **0%** | entirely null |
| `noi_estimate` | **0%** | entirely null |
| `cap_rate` | **0%** | entirely null |
| `building_square_feet` | **100%** | present everywhere |
| `units_count` | **100%** | present (selection key) |
| `tax_amt` | **~99.1%** (24,756) | public tax record → `PROVIDER_REPORTED`/`ACTUAL` candidate |
| `total_loan_balance` | numeric on 100% | **but 59% are `0`** (14,704) — ambiguous *free-and-clear* vs *missing-coded-as-zero* |
| `total_loan_payment` | numeric on 100% | annual payment/balance ratio ≈ **0.36** (implausible for P&I) → treat as `PROVIDER_REPORTED`, **low reliability** for DSCR |
| `total_loan_amt` | numeric on 100% | original loan amount |
| `past_due_amount` | **0%** | null on income assets |
| `mls_current_listing_price` | ~0% (10 rows) | negligible |

`properties.raw_payload_json` was probed across 4,000 income rows: the **only** income-adjacent keys present are `tax_amt`, `total_loan_*`, `units_count` (and `_1` duplicates). **No** rent / lease / occupancy / income / NOI / cap / expense keys exist in the raw provider payload. There is **no** rent-roll, lease, rental-comparable, operating-statement, or underwriting/override table in the schema (`rent_comp|rental_comp|lease|rent_roll|underwrit|operating_statement` → 0 tables).

**Conclusion:** live income valuation is data-blocked. Rent, occupancy, NOI, cap rate, and operating expenses must be treated as `UNKNOWN` (never zero); NOI/cap/GRM stay provisional. The only qualified income-adjacent evidence today is **property taxes** (~99%) and **debt** (present but low-reliability and zero-ambiguous). Comparable PPU/PPSF (from `buyer_comp_raw_v2`) remains the only qualified valuation path for most income properties. Do not fabricate rents/NOI/cap/expenses.

### Source inventory (income-relevant)

| `recently_sold_properties` | 1/sold | `mls_current_listing_price`,`raw_payload` | PROVIDER | property | sale evidence; no rent |

### Reliability flags

- **Debt zero-ambiguity:** `total_loan_balance = 0` (59% of income assets) cannot be distinguished between *free-and-clear* (actual 0) and *missing*. The canonical loader treats provider `0` balance as `OWNER_REPORTED`-equivalent **`PROVIDER_REPORTED` with a free-and-clear flag + reduced confidence**, never as a verified ACTUAL zero that authorizes subject-to.
- **Payment reliability:** annualized `total_loan_payment / total_loan_balance` ≈ 0.36 is implausible for amortizing P&I → flagged `PROVIDER_REPORTED`, low confidence; insufficient alone to make subject-to/seller-finance *underwritten*.
- **Census is geo-level**, never a property rent. May only feed `MARKET_MODELED` market-rent priors and occupancy context, clearly labeled.
- **Conversation occupancy** (`thread_ai_state.occupancy_status`) is the designed home for `OWNER_REPORTED` facts but is currently 0% populated — an enrichment target, not a present source.

### By state (top 8, income assets)

| State | Count | Tax | Debt > 0 | Any rent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FL | 6,366 | 98.3% | 32.3% | 0% |
| IL | 5,442 | 99.3% | 36.4% | 0% |
| CA | 4,896 | ~100% | 65.1% | 0% |
| TX | 1,350 | 98.8% | 35.0% | 0% |
| RI | 893 | 100% | 49.7% | 0% |
| MN | 838 | 99.9% | 33.1% | 0% |
| PA | 822 | 98.2% | 40.0% | 0% |
| CT | 733 | 100% | 46.9% | 0% |

**Coverage conclusions:**
- **Rent / NOI / cap / occupancy: 0% in every lane and state.** No conflicts and no stale records exist because there are no income records at all.
- **Square feet + unit count: 100%** — comp PPU/PPSF valuation is fully supported.
- **Taxes: ~99%** — usable property-specific expense evidence (`PROVIDER_REPORTED`).
- **Debt: numeric on 100%, but only 38–55% have a positive balance** (rest are `0` = ambiguous free-and-clear vs missing). Payment present on a similar share; reliability low (see audit §reliability). Debt may seed *shadow* subject-to/seller-finance only — never authorize.
- Alternate-source coverage gain is **negligible**: `raw_payload_json`, comps, and census contain no per-property rent/NOI/occupancy.

## Item 5C — Enrichment plan (ranked)

| # | Gap | Lanes affected | Source class | Importance | Coverage gain | Confidence impact | Effort | Dependency | Required before |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Owner-reported rent / occupancy** via existing seller conversations (`thread_ai_state.occupancy_status` + new extraction) | all income | already present pipeline, 0% populated → conversation extraction | High | Medium (only engaged leads) | OWNER_REPORTED (med) | Med — extraction contract exists (this pass); wire population later | shadow underwriting per-deal |
| 2 | **Tax → expense seeding** (taxes already ~99%) connect into expense model | all income | data present, not connected | High | High | raises expense completeness | Low | none | shadow |
| 3 | **Debt-aware shadow subject-to** using present loan balance/payment (flag zero-ambiguous, low confidence) | 2–4 + MF | data present, low reliability | Med | High (numeric) | low (provider) | Low | none | shadow only — NOT authorization |
| 4 | **Rent-roll / lease document upload** (verified actual rent + occupancy) | all income | document upload (new) | High | High where obtained | ACTUAL/VERIFIED (high) | Med — UI + parser | document pipeline | underwritten income value |
| 5 | **Qualified rental comparables** (actual signed rents) | all income | new approved provider OR MLS-derived | High | High | COMPARABLE_DERIVED (med) | High | provider/legal — UNVERIFIED today | qualified market rent |
| 6 | **Observed cap-rate evidence** (qualified single-asset sale + time-aligned NOI) | MF 5+ | derivable once NOI exists; needs both sale + NOI | Med | Low (rare) | OBSERVED (high) | Med | depends on #4/#5 | qualified cap model |
| 7 | **Provider rent estimate** (e.g. AVM rent) | all income | current provider IF it offers rent | Med | High if available | PROVIDER_REPORTED (low/med) | Low | provider capability **UNVERIFIED** | market-rent prior |
| 8 | **Actual operating statements / T-12** | MF 5+ | document upload | Med | Low (large deals only) | ACTUAL (high) | Med | document pipeline | underwritten NOI for 5+ |

**Notes:** No provider rent capability is claimed as available — items #5 and #7 are explicitly gated on *unverified* provider capability. Items #1–#3 are achievable with data/pipelines already in the repo and are the highest-leverage near-term moves; none enable autonomous execution.

## Item 5D — Self-Storage Intelligence & Underwriting (live audit, 2026-06-22)

Read-only observations from production Supabase `real-estate-automation`
(`lcppdrmrdfblstpcbgpf`). No production data was written.

### 1. Inventory & classification

Likely self-storage records identified from `public.properties` by ORing the
storage boolean flags, the `storage_units` numeric column, and a keyword scan
over the asset-classification text fields (`property_type`, `asset_class`,
`asset_subtype`, `normalized_asset_class`, `asset_label`, `land_use`, `zoning`,
`original_property_type`, `commercial_property_type`). Keywords: self storage,
mini storage, mini warehouse, storage facility, storage unit(s), climate
controlled storage, vehicle/RV/boat storage, warehouse storage, storage condo,
portable storage.

| Signal | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| **Likely self-storage properties (any signal)** | **376** |
| `is_storage` / `is_storage_facility` = true | 372 |
| `is_self_storage` / `is_self_storage_facility` = true | **0 (never populated)** |
| `is_mini_storage` / `is_mini_storage_facility` = true | **0 (never populated)** |
| `storage_units` not null | **0 (never populated)** |
| keyword-only (no boolean flag) | 4 |

Classification is coarse/binary — only a generic `is_storage` flag is populated.
The data does **not** distinguish self-storage facility vs. mini-warehouse vs.
storage condominium vs. portable/mobile-storage business vs. vehicle/RV/boat
storage. `asset_type_confidence` is null for all 376.

### 2. Markets / states & physical variants

| State | Count | Avg bldg sqft | <10k sqft | 10k–50k | >50k |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| CA | 205 | 6,034 | 185 | 15 | 5 |
| TX | 97 | 24,455 | 30 | 53 | 14 |
| AZ | 27 | 44,860 | 3 | 14 | 10 |
| FL | 17 | 26,816 | 5 | 8 | 4 |
| GA | 13 | 18,136 | 6 | 5 | 2 |
| NV | 8 | 28,543 | 2 | 5 | 1 |
| WA | 5 | 56,978 | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| PA | 3 | 1,629 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| MN | 1 | 226 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

**Misclassification / package risk is material.** The CA cohort (205; 90% under
10k sqft; avg ~6k sqft) is dominated by records too small to be genuine
multi-building facilities — almost certainly garages, individual storage
*condominiums*, or properties carrying a storage land-use code rather than
operating facilities. TX/AZ/FL (avg 24k–45k sqft, majority 10k–50k) are
physically plausible facilities. **The classifier applies a physical-
plausibility gate (building/NRSF floor) before treating a storage-flagged record
as a genuine facility**, and never assumes a storage flag implies an operating
facility.

### 3. Operating-data coverage (critical finding)

Across all 376 likely-storage records:

| Field | Coverage | Note |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `building_square_feet` (GBA proxy) | 376 / 376 (100%) | gross only — **no NRSF column exists** |
| `lot_square_feet` | 376 / 376 (100%) | land/expansion proxy |
| `units_count` > 0 | 111 / 376 (29.5%) | parcel/garage units — **not** storage rentable units |
| `storage_units` | 0 / 376 | column exists, never populated |
| `noi_estimate` | 0 / 376 | **no NOI anywhere** |
| `cap_rate` | 0 / 376 | **no cap rate anywhere** |
| `monthly_rent` / `rent_estimate` | 0 / 376 | **no rent anywhere** |
| `mls_current_listing_price` | 0 / 376 | no asking price |
| occupancy / economic occupancy | n/a | **no column exists** |
| unit mix / climate-control / drive-up / vehicle spaces | n/a | **no column exists** |
| expense lines (taxes/ins/payroll/mgmt/utilities/repairs/…) | n/a | **no column exists** |
| ancillary income (tenant insurance/admin/late/merch/truck) | n/a | **no column exists** |
| debt terms (balance/rate/maturity/balloon/covenants) | n/a | not on `properties` for storage |

**Zero genuine storage operating data exists in production.** The only known
facts are physical size (GBA proxy + lot) and a coarse storage flag.

### 4. Qualified comparable transactions

Storage transactions searched in both fact tables by matching `property_type` /
`normalized_asset_class` against the storage keyword set:

| Source | Storage rows | With price | With sqft | States |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `buyer_comp_raw_v2` | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `buyer_purchase_events_v2` | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The buyer transaction universe is **residential-only**: `single_family`
(48,533), `multifamily` (5,046), `apartment` (1,900). No commercial, no
warehouse, no self-storage transactions at all. Storage buyer-identity coverage
is 0%; storage package/portfolio rate is undefined (no transactions).

### 5. Source / record-grain summary

| Table / view | Grain | Storage-relevant fields | Source | Coverage | Reliability | Join key | As-of | Underwriting suitability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `public.properties` | 1 / property | `is_storage*`, `building_square_feet`, `lot_square_feet`, `units_count`, `property_type`, `asset_*`, `land_use`, `zoning` | provider import | size 100%; flags binary; operating 0% | LOW for facility-truth; OK for size | `property_id` | `asset_classified_at` (sparse) | physical size + provisional classification only |
| `public.buyer_comp_raw_v2` | 1 / comp sale | `property_type`, `normalized_asset_class`, `sale_price`, `building_square_feet`, `property_address_state`, `sale_date` | provider/MLS | 0 storage rows | n/a for storage | identity keys | `sale_date` | none for storage |
| `public.buyer_purchase_events_v2` | 1 / buyer purchase | `normalized_asset_class`, `purchase_price`, `sqft`, `buyer_type`, `property_state` | derived | 0 storage rows (residential-only) | n/a for storage | `normalized_buyer_name` | event date | none for storage |
| `public.buyer_entities_v2` | 1 / buyer | `buyer_type`, `preferred_asset_classes[]`, `avg/median_purchase_price` | derived | no storage preference observed | n/a | `normalized_buyer_name` | rollup | none for storage |

### 6. Conclusion → engine behavior

The self-storage model is built to be **correct when evidence exists**, but on
the **current production inventory it returns DATA_REQUIRED / PROVISIONAL_
SCENARIO for every record** — never a fabricated qualified value, NOI, cap rate,
or authorized offer. Item 5D therefore ships deterministic, source-traceable
storage models + a class-first qualifier that gates on real evidence depth;
supplements tests with **clearly-labeled deterministic fixtures** (not a
production sample); and leaves all outbound execution and persistence disabled.
No storage-specific migration is required — the canonical income snapshot
(JSONB + structured provenance) absorbs all storage fields (mission §20).

---

## Item 5D.5 — Integrity pass (classification hardening, 2026-06-22)

Read-only review of the 376 storage-flagged records, classified by the new
record-level classifier (`classifyStorageRecord`). A single binary `is_storage`
flag is never sufficient for an operating facility; a genuine facility needs
plausible size **and** corroboration (multiple buildings, units, an explicit
self-storage keyword, or operating data).

### Record-class distribution (SQL mirror of the authoritative JS classifier)

| Record class | Count | ≥10k sqft | Avg sqft |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| GARAGE_OR_ACCESSORY_STORAGE | 190 | 0 | ~3,049 |
| OPERATING_SELF_STORAGE_FACILITY | 103 | 80 | ~30,594 |
| AMBIGUOUS_STORAGE | 61 | 61 | ~37,602 |
| LAND_ONLY_STORAGE_USE | 22 | 0 | ~282 |

**~73% (273/376) are gated out of confirmed-facility pricing** as
garage/accessory, ambiguous (size-plausible but binary-flag-only, no
units/keyword), or land. The SQL is an approximation of the authoritative JS
classifier (sensitive to the population filter); the JS classifier governs the
engine.

### Review buckets (read-only; no classifications written to production)

| Bucket | Dominant classes |
| --- | --- |
| CA <10k sqft (185) | GARAGE_OR_ACCESSORY (107, avg ~2.2k), small keyword-labeled OPERATING/MINI (57, avg ~4.5k, no units), LAND_ONLY (21) |
| CA ≥10k sqft (20) | OPERATING (14, avg ~40.7k), AMBIGUOUS (6, avg ~28.9k, no units) |
| TX (97) | OPERATING (61, avg ~22.9k, avg ~103 units), AMBIGUOUS (24, avg ~38.4k, no units), GARAGE (12) |
| MN (1) | LAND_ONLY (226 sqft) |

### Key consequence

Even records that classify as OPERATING/MINI/CLIMATE remain
**PRODUCTION_PRICING_NOT_CALIBRATED**: there is still zero operating data
(NOI/cap/rent/occupancy) and zero qualified storage transactions, so no qualified
value, observed cap, or authorized offer can be produced for any live record.
AMBIGUOUS / GARAGE / CONDO / LAND records route to **DATA_REQUIRED** and never
invoke a confirmed-facility shadow valuation.

### Authorization-semantics correction (§2)

The execution-state contract was hardened to remove the prior ambiguity where an
UNDERWRITTEN_SHADOW cash strategy was reported `cash_scenario_only = true`. The
corrected representative stabilized fixture now reports: cash
`qualification_status = UNDERWRITTEN_SHADOW`, `underwritten = true`,
`scenario_only = false`, `shadow_approved = true`, `live_authorized = false`;
`execution_state = SHADOW_MODE_READY` with `execution_state_basis_strategy = CASH`;
`live_authorized_strategy = null`, `outbound_execution_enabled = false`. Monetary
figures are tiered into scenario_* / shadow_* / authorized_* — shadow figures are
populated, authorized figures remain null while unsafe execution flags are off.

### Production-readiness ceiling

- Architecture: **ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATED**, **DATA_MODEL_READY**,
  **DETERMINISTIC_FIXTURE_VALIDATED** (48 storage tests green).
- Live data: **LIVE_CLASSIFICATION_PARTIAL**,
  **LIVE_TRANSACTION_DATA_UNAVAILABLE**, **LIVE_OPERATING_DATA_UNAVAILABLE** →
  ceiling **PRODUCTION_PRICING_NOT_CALIBRATED**. `AUTONOMOUS_READY` is never
  reachable while execution flags are disabled.

---

## Item 5E — Retail & strip-center intelligence & underwriting (2026-06-22)

### 0. Preflight semantic result (storage authorization blocker)

Reviewed the storage representative strategy blocker (`qualification_status =
UNDERWRITTEN_SHADOW`, `underwritten = true`, `shadow_approved = true`,
authorization blocker included `not_executable_economics`).

**Determination: Case B** — the economics are underwritten; only LIVE execution
is disabled. `UNDERWRITTEN_SHADOW` is in `UNDERWRITTEN_SET` (so `underwritten =
true`) and `shadow_approved` is computed independently of `EXECUTABLE`; the only
reason `status !== EXECUTABLE` is the exec/confidence flag layer (see
`selfStorageStrategies.js` line ~85: "EXECUTABLE requires the exec flag"). The
prior label `not_executable_economics` wrongly implied the *economics* failed a
gate. **Fix:** renamed the blocker to the unambiguous live-execution gate
`live_execution_not_authorized`, preserving `underwritten` + `shadow_approved`;
added a regression test (`acquisition-v3-item5e-retail.test.mjs` §0). No economic
gate was weakened — economic-gate failures remain surfaced via `not_underwritten`
/ `scenario_only_economics`. The same hardened semantics are mirrored in the new
retail strategy module.

### 1 & 24. Live retail inventory / source audit (read-only calibration)

Read-only Supabase calibration against `public.properties` (124,046 rows) and the
two buyer fact tables.

**Likely-retail inventory:** 237 records. Subtype distribution: **100% labeled
`property_type = 'Strip Malls'`** — a single coarse import label; there is no
granular retail subtype, single-tenant/NNN flag, anchor field, or suite roster in
the data. A generic flag alone cannot establish a high-confidence subtype
(mission §2), so every live record classifies AMBIGUOUS/center-only.

| Dimension | Coverage |
| --- | ---: |
| States / markets | **TX only** (237/237) |
| GLA / building sqft | 237 / 237 (100%) — range 1,000–112,072, avg 14,770 |
| Land (lot) sqft | 237 / 237 (100%) |
| Suite / unit coverage | 22 / 237 (9.3%) — coarse parcel units, **not** retail suites |
| Sub-10k sqft share | 123 / 237 (51.9%) — many likely freestanding/storefront, not centers |
| Occupancy coverage | **0** (no column populated) |
| Lease / tenant coverage | **0** (no lease/tenant/GLA/anchor/CAM/WALE columns exist) |
| Rent coverage (`monthly_rent`/`rent_estimate`) | **0** |
| Expense coverage | **0** |
| NOI coverage (`noi_estimate`) | **0** |
| Cap-rate coverage (`cap_rate`) | **0** |
| Listing price (`mls_current_listing_price`) | **0** |
| Debt coverage | n/a on `properties` for retail |

**Schema reality:** the only income-ish columns on `properties` are the generic
`cap_rate, noi_estimate, monthly_rent, rent_estimate, mls_current_listing_price`
(shared across all asset classes) — **all zero/NULL for the 237 retail records**.
No lease-level, tenant, GLA, anchor, CAM, or WALE columns exist anywhere.

### 4. Qualified retail comparable transactions

| Source | Retail rows | With price | States |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `buyer_comp_raw_v2` | **0** | 0 | 0 |
| `buyer_purchase_events_v2` | **0** | 0 | 0 |

The buyer transaction universe is **residential-only** (`single_family`,
`multifamily`, `apartment`). No retail/strip/net-lease/shopping transactions at
all. Retail buyer-identity coverage is **0%**; package/portfolio rate is undefined
(no transactions). False-positive risk is material: the coarse `'Strip Malls'`
label cannot distinguish a genuine multi-tenant center from a freestanding/single-
tenant storefront, a specialty use (gas/auto/restaurant), or a mixed-use parcel.

### 5. Source / record-grain summary

| Table / view | Grain | Retail-relevant fields | Source | Coverage | Reliability | Join key | As-of | Suitability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `public.properties` | 1 / property | `property_type='Strip Malls'`, `building_square_feet`, `lot_square_feet`, `units_count`, `land_use`, `zoning` | provider import | size 100%; operating 0% | LOW for tenancy-truth; OK for size | `property_id` | sparse | physical size + provisional classification only |
| `public.buyer_comp_raw_v2` | 1 / comp sale | `property_type`, `sale_price`, `building_square_feet`, state, `sale_date` | provider/MLS | 0 retail rows | n/a | identity keys | `sale_date` | none for retail |
| `public.buyer_purchase_events_v2` | 1 / buyer purchase | `normalized_asset_class`, `purchase_price`, `sqft`, `buyer_type` | derived | 0 retail rows (residential-only) | n/a | `normalized_buyer_name` | event date | none for retail |

### 6. Conclusion → engine behavior

The retail model is built to be **correct when evidence exists**, but on the
**current production inventory it returns DATA_REQUIRED / PROVISIONAL_SCENARIO for
every record** — never a fabricated qualified value, NOI, cap rate, lease, or
authorized offer. Item 5E ships deterministic, source-traceable retail models +
a class-first qualifier that gates on real evidence depth (genuine retail
classification, GLA/defensible rentable area, lease/transaction evidence,
supportable buyer exit, capital + rollover costs); specialty uses (gas station,
car wash, auto service, dealership, restaurant business sale, business
opportunity) are separated and routed to DATA_REQUIRED / a future specialty lane
and never enter generic retail pricing; mixed-use and warehouse-showroom are
likewise separated. Qualified paths are exercised with **clearly-labeled
deterministic fixtures** (not a production sample). All outbound execution and
persistence remain disabled.

No retail-specific migration is required — the canonical income snapshot (JSONB +
structured provenance, Item 5C) absorbs all retail/lease/tenant fields via the
additive `retail` analysis block; the lease-level entity fits the existing
canonical architecture without a new normalized table (mission §25).

### Production-readiness ceiling (Item 5E)

- Architecture: **ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATED**, **DATA_MODEL_READY**,
  **DETERMINISTIC_FIXTURE_VALIDATED** (45 retail tests green).
- Live data: **LIVE_CLASSIFICATION_PARTIAL**, **LIVE_LEASE_DATA_UNAVAILABLE**,
  **LIVE_TRANSACTION_DATA_UNAVAILABLE**, **LIVE_OPERATING_DATA_UNAVAILABLE** →
  ceiling **PRODUCTION_PRICING_NOT_CALIBRATED**. `AUTONOMOUS_READY` is never
  reachable while execution flags are disabled.

### V2 additivity & isolation

`buildRetailAnalysis` runs ONLY for `RETAIL_STRIP_CENTER` / `RETAIL_SINGLE_TENANT`
lanes and is surfaced as an additive `v3.retail` block; non-retail lanes return
`null` and the generic V2/residential flow stays byte-identical. Retail is
isolated from office / industrial / self-storage / multifamily — no cross-lane
comp substitution, cap rate, or expense ratio.

---

## Item 5F — Office & Medical-Office Intelligence & Underwriting

### Cross-lane reuse audit (§0)

The codebase already establishes the pattern that each commercial lane
(`selfStorage*`, `retail*`) is a parallel sibling reusing only the genuinely
asset-neutral foundation. Item 5F follows that pattern exactly rather than
extracting new shared modules out of retail (which would risk retail regressions
for no benefit and force office concepts into retail's GLA/anchor abstractions).

- **Reused (asset-neutral, unchanged):** `incomeSnapshotContract.js`
  (provField / EVIDENCE_BASIS / VALIDATION_STATUS / isKnown — field-level
  provenance), `incomeUnderwriting.js` (`computeNOI`, `valueFromCap`,
  `capRateFromValue`, `dscr`, `debtYield`), `modelConstants.js` (lanes, families,
  strategy-qualification states, offer-cost stack, monetary-tier semantics).
- **Office-specific (new):** `officeConstants.js`, `officeClassification.js`,
  `officeContract.js`, `officeLeaseModel.js`, `officeUnderwriting.js`,
  `officeComps.js`, `officeValuation.js`, `officeBuyerExit.js`,
  `officeStrategies.js`, `officeDecision.js`.
- **Medical-office-specific (within the office modules):** medical subtypes +
  record classes, `classifyMedicalTenantCredit`, medical buildout / specialized-TI
  / restoration / regulatory contract fields, `buildMedicalSpecialization`
  (earned-premium-only), medical buyer archetypes, medical comp universes.
- **Regression risk:** none observed — retail/storage modules untouched; the full
  retail suite (45) and storage suite (48) remain green, and a 5F regression test
  exercises `buildRetailAnalysis` directly.

### Live inventory & data audit (§1) — read-only, prod (lcppdrmrdfblstpcbgpf)

| Metric | Value |

**Finding:** there is **no identifiable office or medical-office asset in
production**. Any office building is buried, unlabeled, inside the generic
`Commercial` bucket with no office/medical sub-classification, no building class,
no rentable area, no occupancy/lease/tenant/rent/expense/NOI/cap/transaction/
buyer-identity data. This is even thinner than retail (which has 237 `Strip
Malls`). Office-specific coverage — rentable-area, suite, floor, parking,
occupancy, lease, tenant, rent, expense, NOI, cap-rate, debt, transaction and
buyer-identity — is therefore **0** live, and package rate / false-positive risk
are undefined for office because no office records are classifiable yet.

Source grain/reliability is identical to the retail finding: a single
`properties` row per parcel, `property_type` the only populated asset signal
(coarse, provider-reported), no rent-roll/lease/operating grain, no time-aligned
NOI, no qualified office sale comp. Not suitable for live office underwriting
today; suitable only for classification + deterministic-fixture validation.

### Classification architecture (§2)

`officeClassification.js` separates three questions: (1) genuine ordinary office
vs **medical office** (distinct `OFFICE_MEDICAL` lane) vs **special review**
(life science / data center / hospital / coworking operating business / converted
residential / mixed-use); (2) subtype (CBD/suburban × Class A/B/C, low/mid/high-
rise, single/multi-tenant, owner-user, **office condominium** ≠ whole building,
government, corporate campus, creative, vacant, redevelopment, or a specific
medical subtype); (3) tenancy + operational status. A generic office flag alone
never proves a high-confidence subtype, medical use, life-science or data-center
use; special-review keywords are recognized so they route to review rather than
silently pricing as ordinary office.

### Canonical contract, lease, tenant (§3–§5)

`officeContract.js` layers an office contract on the canonical income snapshot:
rentable vs usable area + **load factor**, floors/suites/floor-plate/elevators/
parking (covered/structured)/systems, physical vs **leased** vs economic occupancy
+ direct/sublease/shadow vacancy, separated parking/signage/amenity income, and a
medical block (buildout %, specialized electrical/gas/shielding/surgery infra,
specialized-TI replacement cost, conversion cost). `officeLeaseModel.js`
recognizes FSG / modified-gross / NNN-family / owner-occupied / **coworking
license** / ground lease (a coworking license is never durable lease income; NNN
is never inferred from one pass-through), and classifies office and medical tenant
credit where a **brand is not a guaranty** and **hospital proximity is not health-
system credit**.

### Underwriting, valuation, strategies (§6–§22)

Rent-roll (no fabricated suite precision; WALE/WALT, tenant + industry
concentration, unknown-credit exposure), revenue (parking/signage separated;
coworking service revenue excluded), expense (FSG retains opex, NNN ≠ full
recovery, reimbursement leakage, elevator only for mid/high-rise, medical-systems
maintenance), NOI (debt/capex/TI-LC/business income excluded), rollover
(12/24/36/60-mo, office and higher medical TI/LC + downtime, medical buildout
exposure), distress/obsolescence (WFH risk, sublease overhang, conversion
feasibility, dark/redevelopment value), cap rate (OBSERVED / IMPLIED /
MODELED_MARKET separated; observed requires observed NOI), valuation methods A–K
computed independently with **owner-user value a separate universe** excluded from
the investor blend and **medical-specialized value capped at ordinary-office
support unless an earned premium is evidenced**, business-value separation
(coworking/practice/equipment/goodwill excluded), buyer-exit (general vs medical
archetypes; portfolio = demand-only), and class-first strategy qualification
(cash / seller-finance / commercial-debt-takeover / office marketed disposition ≠
residential novation / owner-user disposition) with hardened monetary tiers and an
explicit execution-state basis. AUTO and live authorization stay disabled; shadow
amounts never populate authorized fields.

### Production-readiness ceiling (Item 5F)

- Architecture / data model / deterministic fixtures:
  **DETERMINISTIC_FIXTURE_VALIDATED** (57 office tests green).
- Live data: **LIVE_CLASSIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE** (no office records),
  **LIVE_LEASE_DATA_UNAVAILABLE**, **LIVE_TRANSACTION_DATA_UNAVAILABLE**,
  **LIVE_OPERATING_DATA_UNAVAILABLE** → ceiling
  **PRODUCTION_PRICING_NOT_CALIBRATED**. `AUTONOMOUS_READY` is never returned while
  execution flags are disabled.

### Calibration (§24)

Qualified office paths (observed cap, qualified comp universe, qualified buyer
exit, CASH `UNDERWRITTEN_SHADOW`, `SHADOW_MODE_READY`) are exercised only with
clearly-labeled deterministic fixtures (a stabilized suburban Class B office and a
hospital-affiliated MOB), never a production sample, because no office operating /
lease / transaction evidence exists in production. Live-authorization rate is
**null/0** by construction.

### Migrations (§25)

No migration required or applied. The canonical income snapshot (JSONB +
structured provenance, Item 5C) absorbs all office/medical lease/tenant/rentable-
area/medical-buildout fields via the additive `office` analysis block; the lease-
level entity fits the existing canonical architecture without a new normalized
table. A future normalized commercial-lease model remains a recorded pre-shadow-
persistence option, not a 5F requirement.

### Additivity

`buildOfficeAnalysis` runs ONLY for `OFFICE_GENERAL` / `OFFICE_MEDICAL` lanes and
is surfaced as an additive `v3.office` block; non-office lanes return `null` and
the generic V2/residential flow stays byte-identical. Office is isolated from
retail / industrial / self-storage / multifamily, and medical office is isolated
from general office — no cross-lane comp substitution, cap rate, or expense ratio.
